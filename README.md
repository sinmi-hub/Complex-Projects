# Complex-Projects

   Here, I want to test my limits and understanding when it comes to programming and coding by implementing real life technologies used every single day. This will simply be a collection of my personal experiments in compiler design, distributed systems, and version control exploration. Since I have a good mastery of C, most of this projects will be in C, however, I am excited to learn Rust and C++. So we will see how the journey goes. Here are the projects implemented so far:

## BitTorrent Client

- Description
	BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer file sharing protocol used for distributing large amounts of data. Here, I build a BitTorrent client that's capable of downloading a publicly available file using the BitTorrent protocol. BitTorrent helps file downloads to be a lot faster and reduces server load. More information about this project will be in the READMe file of the BitTorrent directory.
- Model Inspiration and Real life use
    Tranmission is an open source BitTorrent Client that is used by Ubuntu (as of May 2024)
- Status: In Progress
