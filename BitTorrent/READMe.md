### bencoding
Bencode (pronounced Bee-encode) is a serialization format used in the BitTorrent protocol. It is used in torrent files and in communication between trackers and peers.

Bencode supports four data types:

    strings
    integers
    arrays
    dictionaries
This serialization logic is implemented in bencode.c
