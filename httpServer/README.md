# Complex-Projects

   Here, I want to test my limits and understanding when it comes to programming and coding by implementing real life technologies used every single day. This will simply be a collection of my personal experiments in compiler design, distributed systems, and version control exploration. Since I have a good mastery of C, most of this projects will be in C, however, I am excited to learn Rust and C++. So we will see how the journey goes. Here are the projects implemented so far:
